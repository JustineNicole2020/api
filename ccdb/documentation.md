### Updated API available now

The CFPB is updating its API service to ensure seamless data availability for users and real time consistency with the Consumer Complaint Database. As a result, The Socrata platform will be retired on **01/06/2020**. Check out our [complaint search tool](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/) and the [new API service documentation](api.html) to learn more about upcoming changes to the Consumer Complaint Database API.


### API documentation

The Consumer Complaint Database is driven by Socrata’s Open Data API. You can use Socrata’s API documentation to learn how to search, filter and use our complaint data. The Consumer Complaint Database's application programming interface (API) allows you to filter and download complaint data in machine-readable formats.

### Updated API available now

The CFPB recently updated its Application Programming Interface (API) service to ensure seamless data availability for users and real-time consistency with the Consumer Complaint Database. The Socrata platform will be retired in early January 2020. Check out our [search tool](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/) and the new [API service](api.html) to learn more about consumer complaints.


### API documentation

The Consumer Complaint Database is driven by Socrata’s Open Data API. You can use Socrata’s API documentation to learn how to search, filter and use our complaint data. The Consumer Complaint Database's application programming interface (API) allows you to filter and download complaint data in machine-readable formats.
